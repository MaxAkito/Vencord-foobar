                Cider is a cross-platform Apple Music experience built on Vue.js and written from the ground up with performance in mind.

                I'd recommend using TimeBarAllActivities alongside this plugin to give off a much better visual to the eye (Keep in mind this only affects your client and will not show for other users)
